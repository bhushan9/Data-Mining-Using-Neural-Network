Data Mining Using Neural Network
- Neural network designed in java tailored for the dataset "Adult" taken from UCI Repository
- The objective is to predict whether person earns more than $50k given certain attributes such as Age, Education, Experience     etc.
- The neural network uses backpropagation for updating the weights
- For training purpose we use 1000 records and for testing purpose we use 300 records.
- The updated weights can be seen using the Graph Demo.
