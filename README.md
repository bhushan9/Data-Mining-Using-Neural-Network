<h2>Data Mining Using Neural Network </h2>  &nbsp;

* Neural network designed in java tailored for the dataset "Adult" taken from UCI Repository <br>
* The objective is to predict whether person earns more than $50k given certain attributes such as Age, Education, Experience     etc. <br>
* The neural network uses backpropagation for updating the weights<br>
*  For training purpose we use 1000 records and for testing purpose we use 300 records.<br>
*  The updated weights can be seen using the Graph Demo.<br>
